# Job portal 
A website that I developed in order to apply for GEEK UP Summer Intership in 2024.
This website serves users as a platform where employees can seek for jobs in Computer Science in general and Information Technology in specific

## Description
This project **doesn't have any Back-End development**, so the dummy database is hosted through JSON-server and deployed in Vercel.
Due to this, any of POST, PACTH, DELETE OR GET methods won't work probably. Especially, POST or DELETE methods require a significant time to render precisely.
Link to the database: [https://dummy-api-wine.vercel.app/
](https://dummy-database-job-portal.vercel.app/)

## How to use
There are two distinctive roles for users: Employee and Employer
Markup : * Employee
              * View companys
              * Search for occupations, with **Skill, City**, and **Keyword** field
              * Apply for suitable jobs
          * Bullet list item 2
