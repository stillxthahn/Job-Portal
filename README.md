# Job portal 
A website that I developed in order to apply for GEEK UP Summer Intership in 2024.


This website serves users as a platform where employees can seek for jobs in Computer Science in general and Information Technology in specific

## Description
This project **doesn't have any Back-End development**, so the dummy database is hosted through JSON-server and deployed in Vercel.



Due to this, any of **POST, PACTH, DELETE OR GET** methods won't work probably. Especially, **POST or DELETE** methods require a significant time to render precisely.



Link to the database: [https://dummy-api-wine.vercel.app/
](https://dummy-database-job-portal.vercel.app/)

## How to use
There are two distinctive roles for users: Employee and Employer



* Employee
  * View companys
  * Search for occupations, with **Skill, City**, and **Keyword** field
  * Apply CVs for suitable jobs
  * Sig up as a employer
* Employer
  * With basic utilizations of employee, an employer can further log in or sign up as an administrator to manange their own company, jobs and CVs applied
